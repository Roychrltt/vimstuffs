### Leave my snippets here in case one day I get suspected of cheating 

To install Nord terminal theme on **Mac**: 

`https://github.com/nordtheme/terminal-app`

Do `:source ~/.vimrc` from within a vim file, not in the terminal.

After adding plugins, do `:PluginInstall` in ~/.vimrc

Use `vim --versioni | grep python` to check if `+python3` is supported.

To install Oh-My-Zsh, the default shell needs to be zsh. After installing zsh, you should restart the machine or add `exec zsh` to `~/.bashrc`

Use `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` to install gopls, add the path to ~/.zshrc

Run `:GoInstallBinaries` in vim to install gopls, goimports, guru and other useful binaries
